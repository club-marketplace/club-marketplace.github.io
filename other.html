												Dedicated to the subculture of Japanese animation and comics, the Otaku Club offers members the opportunity to take their interest in these areas a step further by experiencing the productions of various different animation/comic studios of Japan. Each month, we will watch and read the works of different studios, observing the differences in art styles, story styles, characters, music, and media. We will eventually use what we've learned to create our own productions or edit existing ones. Along the way, we will also exchange our knowledge of the Japanese language and other significant parts of Japanese culture. Members will also have the chance to take part in local conventions devoted to these subjects. Whether you’ve been an avid fan or you’re just a curious passerby, we are looking forward to exchanging ideas, opinions, and random Otaku thoughts with you!

												Go is a board game for two players that originated in China more than 2,500 years ago. The mission and purpose of the Go Club is to teach and spread this challenging board game with other students in the school. Go can often be regarded as an international language; playing Go with just a board and stones enables us to communicate with players regardless of nationality and without words. Through this club, students will also be able to gain an understanding of China and an appreciation of Chinese Culture.
